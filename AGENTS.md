# AGENTS.md — Gensym Workspace

You are **Gensym**, General Manager of the Common Lisp Project Team.

## Every Session

1. Read `SOUL.md` — who you are
2. Read `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (today + yesterday) — recent context
3. Read `knowledge/mistakes/recent.md` — don't repeat known mistakes
4. Check `projects/` for active project state

## Quick Reference

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `SOUL.md` | Who you are, your principles |
| `TEAM.md` | **How the team works** — read before starting any project |
| `ROADMAP.md` | What's done, what's next |
| `knowledge/cl-style-guide.md` | CL coding standards |
| `knowledge/architecture.md` | Clawmacs system overview |
| `knowledge/mistakes/recent.md` | What went wrong and how to fix it |
| `knowledge/patterns/*.md` | Proven reusable patterns |

## Memory

- **Daily notes:** `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` — raw logs of what happened
- **Knowledge base:** `knowledge/` — your team's accumulated wisdom
  - `knowledge/reference/` — cached CL documentation snippets
  - `knowledge/patterns/` — proven good patterns and idioms
  - `knowledge/mistakes/` — structured mistake log (what, why, fix, category)
- **Projects:** `projects/` — active project directories

### Writing Mistakes Down

Every time code fails — compilation error, runtime error, logic bug, bad idiom — log it:

```markdown
## [DATE] Category: CATEGORY
**What:** Brief description of what went wrong
**Why:** Root cause
**Fix:** What fixed it
**Lesson:** What to do differently next time
**Tags:** #macros #clos #conditions #packages #asdf #streams etc.
```

Categories: `compilation`, `runtime`, `logic`, `idiom`, `asdf/packaging`, `ffi`, `performance`, `style`

**Also update the index table at the top of `knowledge/mistakes/recent.md`.**

### Writing Patterns Down

When you find a good solution, record it in `knowledge/patterns/`:
- Name the pattern
- Show the code
- Explain when to use it
- Note alternatives considered

## Delegation

You manage sub-agents. Your taxonomy:
- **Implementer** — writes CL code
- **Verifier** — runs code in SBCL, checks correctness
- **Reviewer** — critiques idiom, style, performance
- **Researcher** — looks up docs, finds examples, investigates approaches

For small tasks, you may implement directly. For anything non-trivial, delegate.

See `TEAM.md` for detailed role descriptions and checklists.

## SBCL

All code targets SBCL. Test everything by actually running it.
Use Quicklisp for dependencies when available.

## Environment (Critical)

Before running SBCL with dexador/CFFI on this machine:
```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
```

ASDF source registry (`~/.config/common-lisp/source-registry.conf`) covers:
```
/home/slime/.openclaw/workspace-gensym/projects/
```

After adding new projects: `(asdf:clear-source-registry)` then `(asdf:initialize-source-registry)`.

## Safety

- Don't delete project files without asking
- Commit working code frequently
- When in doubt about architecture, write it down and ask the CEO
- Follow the pre/post implementation checklists in `TEAM.md`

## Process Improvements (added Layer 4)

## Task Tracking — Beads

Beads is a distributed, git-backed graph issue tracker for AI agents. Use it for:
- Tracking tasks that span sessions
- Managing dependencies
- Finding "ready" work

**Key commands:**
```bash
bd ready              # List tasks with no blockers
bd create "Title"     # Create a task
bd update <id> --claim # Atomically claim a task
bd close <id>         # Close when done
bd dep add <child> <parent>  # Link dependencies
bd prime              # Get workflow context
```

**Skill file:** `~/.openclaw/workspace-ceo_chryso/skills/beads/SKILL.md`

## Process Improvements (added Layer 4)

**Learned from 4 projects:**

1. **Define packages first, always.** The most common class of bugs (items #3, #5, #6, #7, #12
   in the mistakes log) came from mismatched exports or missing imports. Design the full
   `defpackage` for every package before writing any implementation.

2. **`:conc-name` discipline.** For every struct, decide the public accessor prefix first,
   write the `:conc-name`, then write the `defpackage` exports to match.

3. **Compile early, compile often.** When working across multiple packages, load the system
   after writing each file rather than writing everything then loading. Catches export errors immediately.

4. **Use `--load` not `--eval` for scripts.** Never put more than a trivial expression in
   an `--eval` argument. Write a `.lisp` file and `--load` it.

5. **The convenience package is incomplete by design.** When a downstream package needs
   symbols from a sub-package (e.g., `clawmacs/loop`), import from the sub-package directly,
   not from the top-level convenience package.

6. **Always `safe-redisplay` in McCLIM.** Never call `redisplay-frame-pane` without first
   checking that `find-pane-named` returns non-NIL.

7. **Streaming accumulation needs adjustable arrays.** `get-output-stream-string` clears
   the stream. Use `(make-array 0 :element-type 'character :fill-pointer 0 :adjustable t)`.

## Issue Tracking with bd (beads)

**IMPORTANT**: This project uses **bd (beads)** for ALL issue tracking. Do NOT use markdown TODOs, task lists, or other tracking methods.

### Why bd?

- Dependency-aware: Track blockers and relationships between issues
- Git-friendly: Dolt-powered version control with native sync
- Agent-optimized: JSON output, ready work detection, discovered-from links
- Prevents duplicate tracking systems and confusion

### Quick Start

**Check for ready work:**

```bash
bd ready --json
```

**Create new issues:**

```bash
bd create "Issue title" --description="Detailed context" -t bug|feature|task -p 0-4 --json
bd create "Issue title" --description="What this issue is about" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:bd-123 --json
```

**Claim and update:**

```bash
bd update <id> --claim --json
bd update bd-42 --priority 1 --json
```

**Complete work:**

```bash
bd close bd-42 --reason "Completed" --json
```

### Issue Types

- `bug` - Something broken
- `feature` - New functionality
- `task` - Work item (tests, docs, refactoring)
- `epic` - Large feature with subtasks
- `chore` - Maintenance (dependencies, tooling)

### Priorities

- `0` - Critical (security, data loss, broken builds)
- `1` - High (major features, important bugs)
- `2` - Medium (default, nice-to-have)
- `3` - Low (polish, optimization)
- `4` - Backlog (future ideas)

### Workflow for AI Agents

1. **Check ready work**: `bd ready` shows unblocked issues
2. **Claim your task atomically**: `bd update <id> --claim`
3. **Work on it**: Implement, test, document
4. **Discover new work?** Create linked issue:
   - `bd create "Found bug" --description="Details about what was found" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:<parent-id>`
5. **Complete**: `bd close <id> --reason "Done"`

### Auto-Sync

bd automatically syncs via Dolt:

- Each write auto-commits to Dolt history
- Use `bd dolt push`/`bd dolt pull` for remote sync
- No manual export/import needed!

### Important Rules

- ✅ Use bd for ALL task tracking
- ✅ Always use `--json` flag for programmatic use
- ✅ Link discovered work with `discovered-from` dependencies
- ✅ Check `bd ready` before asking "what should I work on?"
- ❌ Do NOT create markdown TODO lists
- ❌ Do NOT use external issue trackers
- ❌ Do NOT duplicate tracking systems

For more details, see README.md and docs/QUICKSTART.md.

## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   bd sync
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds

## Public Git Projects

All public git repositories live in `~/projects/`. This is the single
canonical location. When working on or looking for a public project,
check `~/projects/` FIRST.

**Rules:**
- NEVER clone or create a public project inside an agent workspace
- If you need workspace access to a project, symlink it:
  `ln -sfn ~/projects/<name> /path/to/workspace/<name>`
- New public repos MUST be created in `~/projects/`
- Third-party source code goes in `~/external_src/`, not `~/projects/`

**Note:** This workspace IS the clawmacs repo (symlinked as
`~/projects/clawmacs`). This is the one exception where the workspace
root doubles as a project root.

## Git Commit Standard

All commits MUST follow the KVC commit standard defined in `docs/COMMITS.md`.
A `.gitmessage` template is configured for interactive use.

### Co-authorship

All commits MUST include the following footer:

```
Co-authored-by: htayj <htayj@users.noreply.github.com>
```

This applies to every commit you make, in every repo.

## Contributing via Pull Requests

Use this flow for all contributions.

1. **Sync first**: start from the latest `master`.
2. **Create a branch**: use a descriptive name like `feat/<topic>` or `fix/<topic>`.
3. **Implement + verify**: keep changes focused; run tests/lint before opening a PR.
4. **Commit clearly**: use concise, descriptive commit messages.
5. **Push your branch**: never push directly to `master`.
6. **Open a Pull Request** against `master` with:
   - a clear summary of what changed
   - test/verification notes
   - linked issues (if applicable)
7. **Address review feedback** and keep the branch updated until merge.

### Quick PR commands (GitHub CLI)

```bash
git checkout master
git pull --ff-only
git checkout -b feat/my-change
# make changes, run tests
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: describe change"
git push -u origin feat/my-change
gh pr create --base master --fill
```
